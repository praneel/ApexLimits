# ApexLimits

Apex includes an entire class dedicated to listing and measuring limits. 

It's no coincidence that the name of this class is Limits. It includes two methods for every limit in Apex. One method is to get the maximum number allowed for a limit, and the other method is to get the number that has already occurred. You can use the combination of both of these types of methods to ensure you never exceed the actual limit. The best part is by using this pattern, your code will easily adjust itself when the limits are relaxed in the future! Find the snippet in the repository.
